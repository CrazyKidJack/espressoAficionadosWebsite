### Pulling shots in pre-infusion mode only

For Breville Infuser and Barista Express users. Possibly for Bambino and Breville Pro users as well, though the lack of gauge may be an issue.

Can be used as an alternative technique when having issues maintaining puck integrity throughout the duration of the shot i.e. due to poor grind quality or when pulling light roasts.

First test that your machine’s pre-infusion (PI) mode is capable of high enough pressures. 
To test: with your cleaning disc/blind disc in the portafilter, hold down either the 1-cup or 2-cup button to keep the pump in PI. Let pressure build until the needle stops moving (this may take around 30s). When the needle stabilises, this is the max PI pressure your machine can achieve. Let go of the button and press it once more to stop the shot. 

If your machine was able to build to at least 9-10bar pressure, this technique could work for you. 

Pressure gauge readings:
The middle line of the grey-shaded “espresso zone” is 10bar. Each line is an increment of 2 bar. 

To pull in PI mode:
Press and hold the 1-cup or 2-cup button for the duration of the shot. When you reach your desired yield, quickly release and then immediately press again the button to stop the shot.

Dialling in
Dial in as you usually would, grinding fine/coarse enough to achieve enough pressure while also maintaining enough flow to reach your desired yield within 60secs.
Breville machines (with the exception of the BDB) have a 60sec shot time limit.
