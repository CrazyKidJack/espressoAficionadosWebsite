# Breville Barista Express Max Shot Time

## Problem

More recent Barista Express machines (at least 2021+) have a volumetric max shot of around 200 grams of water. So, depending on where your OPV is set to or the grind size you use the max time of a shot can be too low to achieve the desire yield or flow profile. This reversible mod will disable the flow meter allowing to always have a max shot time of 60 seconds.

Please note that: 
1. This mod will only allow you to pull shot on manual mode as it disables the volumetric reads
2. Clean function will continue to working properly


## Tools and materials required
* Phillips head screwdriver

## Getting inside your machine
Check [Dimmer mod](https://espressoaf.com/manufacturers/breville/dimmer.html#getting-inside-the-infuser) page to know how to open your machine.

## Disable flow meter
Once the machine is open, locate the flow meter on the bottom left corner of your machine.

Then, use a flat screwdriver or knife to press the gray connectors of the 4 cables and pull them out.

Voil√°! Your shots can now take up to 60s.
