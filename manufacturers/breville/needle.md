# Clippard Valve Upgrade for the Breville Dual Boiler

The Breville Dual Boiler can have manual flow profiling easily and quickly added by rerouting the flow to pass through the stock hot water knob. While this requires no additional parts and can be easily undone, the stock needle valve does not work well for this. Namely, the effective range of motion for flow is in radial a radial movement of several millimeters. This page will describe how to install a new and upgraded valve, discovered by Home-Barista forum user Jake_G. This new needle valve usable range is several rotations allowing for great flexibility in flow profiling.  

This installation is not much more difficult than the original mod, however it does require several commercial and 3D printed parts. I have designed the printed parts to fit with the specified commercial parts exactly and I cannot guarantee other options will work, specifically the socket and the printed paddle.

# DISCLAIMER

This is pretty cutting edge stuff and if you find something here doesn't work for you---let me know! This is collaborative effort and improvements will happen over time.

## 3D Printed Parts

These parts need to printed in filaments with some degree of heat resistance. I have not had good luck with PLA but I have found PETG to be adequate, however ABS and other higher temp filaments are ideal. The mount design was made by [Qporzk](https://github.com/qporzk/BDB-Slayer).

## Installation

### Removing Stock Knob and Valve

1. Remove top cover
2. Remove hot water knob by popping off cover and unscrewing screw in center of knob
3. Remove two screws holding valve to frame
4. Remove two screw holding valve mount inside
5. Disconnect two tubes from valve and remove old valve
6. Cut or pull out brass ferrule and sleeve from the tubes.

### Paddle and Mount Assembly

The paddle can be assembled by hammering the nut settler into shaft, if your printer has tolerances making this difficult, heating the nut settler can help it fit.

The needle valve and mount can be assembled by first applying teflon tape to the male threads of the needle valve and the push connector. Then the Clippard valve can be pushed into the mount and the connectors can be screwed on.

### Attaching the Mount and Final Assembly

1. Attach the new mount by screwing it in through the wall as shown below.

2. Attach tubes by pushing them into the new quick connectors.

3. Slide in the new paddle and make sure the Clippard valve is seated in the socket. 

4. I prefer the valve to be closed at the position shown below. This can be set by closing the valve, removing your paddle and resetting it in at the correct position. 

5. Reassemble the machine and use! I have found the paddle can feel stiff at the start but over time it will smoothen.
