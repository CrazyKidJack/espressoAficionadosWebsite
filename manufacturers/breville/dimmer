# Breville Infuser Reversible Dimmer Mod for Flow Control

## Tools and materials required

* Phillips head screwdriver
* Wire cutter
* Wire stripper and crimp tool
* Male and Female Spade connectors - size blue/16-14awg, preferably insulated
* Extra wire, preferably 14awg
* Something to splice the dimmer to extra wire - I prefer wago connectors for ease of use, especially when I had to quickly swap out different dimmers to find one that worked
* Needle nose pliers
* Something to insulate your wire connections such as heat shrink or electrical tape
* Light dimmer such as [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/GE-Single-Pole-Dimmer-Knobs-Rotate-On-Off-White-and-Light-Almond/16561421)

## Getting inside the Infuser

{: .warning }
MAKE SURE YOUR MACHINE IS TURNED OFF AND UNPLUGGED FROM THE WALL PRIOR TO ATTEMPTING THIS.
Do not attempt to work on a machine that is still plugged into the wall socket, even if the switch is turned off.

There are screws in three locations that need to be removed prior to removing the top and back panels of the machine
1) At the front near the group head
2) At the back
3) At the back underside of the machine.
Don't worry about keeping track of what screw goes where, they are all the same size and length. 

To reveal the screws at the back, remove the water tank. There are five screws at the top of the machine and a screw hidden under the small circular cover next to the tank port

Here are the four screws on the under side of the machine

Now that the screws have been removed, you can remove the top cover of the machine.

Next, pull the back cover off in the direction shown to unclip the connections.

Be careful while removing the back cover - **do not pull the back cover off completely** as it will remain attached via the tube connected to the water tank port.
