## Welcome to the GitHub Pages repo for the Espresso Aficionados website

You can find the website [here](https://espressoaf.com).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Espresso-Aficionados/website/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for this website in Markdown files. Be aware that GitHub's preview isn't always accurate to the formatting used on the website, check out existing pages to see how things are done.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

This website uses the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) theme - you can view its documentation [here](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/).

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Test your changes locally

To preview a rendered version of the site locally, you will need a basic [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) development setup.

To install the necessary software and run a version of the page locally, navigate to this folder on your local disk and execute the following commands:

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should then be able to visit a local version of your page at http://localhost:4000. Changes you make to the files will show up after saving the file and reloading the respective page.
