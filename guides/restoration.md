# Restoration

## Overview
Restoration of an espresso machine is a step by step process of dismantling one and bringing back full functionality along with renewal of seals, polishing or chroming of panels, descaling of pipes and boiler, and replacement of electronics. Often restoration can be similar to a refurbishment and sometimes can be used interchangeably. The definition of a restoration can thus be in flux, but in the end the goal of a restoration is to bring an espresso machine to an improved state of fuctionaility.

This guide is made from experience and mistakes that I hope to impart on anyone looking to take on a project. In theory it is not difficult but having the right tools and instructions will greatly assist in any undetaken endeavors.
