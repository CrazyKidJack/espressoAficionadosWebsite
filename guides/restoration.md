# Restoration

## Overview
Restoration of an espresso machine is a step by step process of dismantling one and bringing back full functionality along with renewal of seals, polishing or chroming of panels, descaling of pipes and boiler, and replacement of electronics. Often restoration can be similar to a refurbishment and sometimes can be used interchangeably. The definition of a restoration can thus be in flux, but in the end the goal of a restoration is to bring an espresso machine to an improved state of fuctionality.

This guide is made from experience and mistakes that I hope to impart on anyone looking to take on a project. In theory it is not difficult but having the right tools and instructions will greatly assist in any undetaken endeavors. 

## Things to Consider when Purchasing a Used Machine
Usually when a machine is purchased for restoration purposes some things must be noted in preparation for the retoration. This will not go over where to sourced used machines and how to negotiate but rather the focus will be as if the buyer is already settled on a price and intends to purchase the machine with a reliable shipping method selected.
* Given the pics (and any additional requested pics) note if there is anything obviously missing from the body panels, inside the boiler, or on the exterior. 
* Inspect the condition of the machine. Is it obvious a major repair or polishing is needed for a specific piece?
* How easy will it be to source the gaskets? Will they need to be made? Are there any other parts missing that can or cannot be sourced?

## A Suggested List of Tools for General Restoration and Maintenance

## Arrival of the Machine and Initial Inspection
So now the machine has arrived at your address. The original inspection made from pictures will now be conducted again more thoroughly now that it is in person. If the machine is picked up in person this inspection can be conducted at the seller's address before agreeing to purchasing it. It is recommended to inspect the machine in a garage or related room in case something hazardous is discovered. Asbestos insulation was often present on these machines if they were made as soon as the mid 1970's, and removing it will be very important before bringing it inside a house or apartment.
* Open up the packaging or crate (a wooden pallet is *highly* preferred over a box for commercial machines, domestic machines can get away with being shipped *properly* in a box) and inspect the contents for any obvious damage.
* Document all the included pieces that were taken off prior to shipment and check for anything missing. 
* If possible, take off enough body panel(s) to inspect the inside. 
* If in doubt, take a picture. Pictures are very useful for remembering where everything goes!
* If something hazardous is discovered keep it in the garage until the material is removed.
