# How to Dial In Espresso: The Basics

When dialling in an espresso shot, there are three main variables you can adjust to affect the taste of your espresso.
- **Dose** a.k.a. grams of coffee in
- **Brew ratio** a.k.a dose in:espresso out. For example, 40g of espresso extracted from 20g of dry grounds is often expressed as a brew ratio of 1:2
- **Grind size** or **Shot time**

### 1. Lock in your dose
Choose a dose that best suits your basket. Underdosing can lead to a soupy puck (though this does not always indicate a bad shot), while overdosing can cause your puck to contact the shower screen, leading to uneven flow of water through the puck.

Also note that higher doses of coffee are harder to extract properly, as there is more coffee to extract _fully_. This is especially true for lighter roasts. If you find yourself struggling to achieve adequate extraction levels, and your shots are tasting sour despite pulling a longer ratio, try dosing 1-2g less in the basket.

_For the sake of this example, lets say we are locking in a dose of 18g_

Note: While dose is a variable that can also be adjusted to affect shot time, for simplicity's sake, it is easier to lock in dose *first* and adjust shot time via changing grind size.

### 2. Quick grind size adjustment
Once your dose is locked in, adjust your grind size so that your shot parameters fall within the ballpark of a 1:2 ratio shot taking 25-30s.
Don't agonize too much over this step, we will refine our grind size later.

### 3. Adjust brew ratio to taste
Once your shot is pulling in the ballpark of 20-35s, we can now adjust brew ratio based to what the shot tastes like.

A 1:2 brew ratio with a 18g dosec in would give us a yield of 36g espresso out.

Is the shot tasting too sour? Increase your brew ratio and instead try pulling a 18g/40g, or even 18/44g ratio.

Is the shot tasting too bitter? Shorten the ratio and instead try 18g/32g.

If your shot is tasting both bitter and sour at the same time, you’re probably extracting unevenly due to channeling - [work on your puck prep!](https://espressoaf.com/guides/puckprep.html)

_Lets say that a brew ratio of 18g/40g is giving us the most balanced tasting shot, with balanced acidity, gentle sweetness, and no astringency_

### 4. Hone in on your grind
Once you’ve found the ratio that works best for this particular coffee, we want to work on opening up our extraction potential.
A finer grind will expose more of the coffee solubles to water and allow more coffee to be extracted. This will generally increase the flavor complexity, body, and texture of the shot. 

As a general rule, you want to grind as fine as you can while still achieving a tasty, balanced shot. At some point, your grind will be too fine, water will struggle to flow evenly through the puck, extraction will diminish, and your shot will start tasting underextracted. It is not uncommon to see shot times decrease when you grind too fine - this is an indication of "channelling", where water has found the path of least resistance.

If you find that flavour starts to drop off, you’ve gone into ‘too fine’ territory. Grind one step coarser, and, as a general rule, this will likely be the best grind size for your current recipe.

Do not worry too much about going over the recommended 25-35seconds that you often see in recipes. While many shots will be tastiest in this range, you will encounter beans that prove the exception to the rule. It is not uncommon to pull a delicious light roast that takes >40secs to reach target yield. Let _taste_ be your guide. 

_Congratulations, you've dialled in your shot!_

### Bonus round
Brew temperatures can play a big role in extraction, especially if you're brewing beans that are roasted very light or very dark. Most beginner machines are set to 200F/93.5c, but for those of you with machines capable of temperature adjustment, this is another variable you can play with once you've locked in your dose, ratio, and grind size.

As a general rule, lower temperatures will extract *less* while higher temperatures will extract *more*.

### Help! My shot tastes bad no matter what I do!

If you find that the shot doesn’t taste good no matter what, it could be your beans, not you! Try cupping your beans to get an overall sense of flavour and an indication of what your shot could taste like. If your beans taste overly sour or bitter during your cupping, chances are you won't be able to get a shot that doesn't taste that way as espresso.
