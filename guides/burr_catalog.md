# The Burr Catalog
## An attempt to understand the naming scheme

Burrs are what makes your coffee beans turn into a usefull substance to make coffee out of, be it espresso, pour over, moka pot or Aeropress. The 'grinder' itself is only a tool to enable the burrs to do their thing. As long as any grinder A, B or C is able to spin burr X in a good fashion, theoretically, they should perform identically in the cup. Atleast that is the notion behind high perfomance burr manufacturers. Other factors are RPM, [Burr alignment](#link), bean feed speed, static-screen (causes 'regrinding') and possibly many more.

## High perfomance burrs

This wiki page contains an overview of existing high-perfomance burrs. Many of which are not made by the OEM of the grinder, but a third party. SSP Grinding is a big player here. We also cover some exceptional burrs from OEM. Mahlk√∂nig / Ditting has a long track record of designing excellent burrs, which look like the basis for many SSP burrs (not getting into legal issues here).

There are hundreds of 'standard-espresso' design burrs. We won't cover those, since most of them perform relatively the same, creating a lot of fines and not a very uniform, or unimodal grind.

We also won't cover conical burrs, due to reasons above & lack of availability of high-perfomance burrs outside OEM.

## Identifying burrs

How to identify burrs? Let's start with the basis:

- Outer diameter/OD (64mm, 83mm, 98mm etc)
- Mounting (2 hole, 3 hole, blind)
- Geometry (Some have 'names' which can be _very_ confusing and contradictory)
- Coating ("Red Speed" "SilverKnight" "Titanium")
