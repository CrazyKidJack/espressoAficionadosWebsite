# What is Profiling?
The ordinary definition of profiling in espresso seems to be: 'Adjusting the flow, pressure, or temperature in a shot to manipulate the extraction and produce a different result.' There are a number of different ways to accomplish this depending on available equipment.
## Fixed Profiles
Every machine you have ever used has a profile of some sort. The least flexible profiles are those that are controlled by a pump and push out a fixed rate of water with no overpressure valve. We go through various changes to the system to get more complex pump machines that do a slightly better job, but the focus of this section is on adjustable profiling systems.

This section is here because it is important to understand that ANY system can be modified based on the below principles to produce excellent coffee. Some may be too instable or expensive to modify, but many machines have been modified in a simple manner to adjust preinfusion, max pressure, or other parameters.
## Adjustable Profiles
There are now a number of machines and mods that allow a ton of control for the end user. These adjustable profilers have one primary benefit worth considering; they decouple the relationship between grind size and flow rate to a certain degree. This allows us to make espresso beverages with really finely or coarsely ground coffees. The effective result is that we can boost extraction, clarity, or strength along with some other taste parameters.

* Water Debit

In a pump machine, the amount of water that comes out of the group without restriction from coffee or a basket. Commonly expressed as (X)ml/s. Variable in flow profiling systems.

## Picking suitable profiles
One of the hardest things about making high and even extractions with an adjustable profiler is getting the coffee wetted relatively evenly. The pre-infusion type you pick has a large impact on how extreme the gradient between the top and bottom of the puck is. I'm an advocate for rapid preinfusion schemas; they get the coffee wet from top to bottom quickly and allow the user to move on to the next phase with no ill effects. Because there is a relatively large gradient of wetness in the puck using very slow preinfusion profiles, I tend to avoid recommending this method.

We've already covered the primary benefit you can derive from using a profiler. As a reminder, you can adjust the flow rate through your coffee more independtly of the grind size. In order to pick our profile, we're predominately determining what level of extraction we want for our chosen strength. If I want a 10% TDS shot at 28% extraction, there is probably only one profile capable of doing this.

Simply put, I recommend 4 base profiles that are fairly adaptable. They're listed here from high to low extraction. Videos coming soon.

1. Blooming allongé

   Recommended for ultra light coffees, especially nordic style filter roasts. I use an ultra fine or turkish grind. My current method is to use my known debit and a timer to add a little less than twice the dry weight of the puck in water as quickly as is reasonable (7ish ml/s) before closing the valve. I leave the valve closed for 30 seconds, and generally see about 4-10g in the cup at this point. I ramp to a debit of about 4.5 ml/s quite quickly and hold. Pressure rarely exceeds 6 bar and should taper naturally.
   
   This profile is best used for coffees that can't withstand the challenging preinfusion and main extraction phase of the blooming profile. If you find yourself with a gusher after your first attempt at blooming a coffee, can't grind finer, and still want more extraction this is a good profile to try.
   
   1:4 ratios and up are the norm here, and extractions should be very high. Vibrant and juicy at ultra high extraction levels. Keep in mind that this profile will not produce thick shots.
   
2. Blooming espresso
   
   Recommended for light to medium light coffees. This shot requires an ultra fine, or turkish grind. My current method is to use my known debit and a timer to add roughly twice the dry weight of the puck in water as quickly as is reasonable (7ish ml/s) before closing the valve. I leave the valve closed for 30 seconds, which is generally where i see first drip. Getting drips or even a small amount of flow sooner is ok if you can’t grind finer. I relatively smoothly ramp to 9 bar and hold after, though a taper could be useful if you’re prone to channeling.
   
   Some coffees will just fall apart after preinfusion using this profile. If you're grinding as fine as you can and managing your puck prep well you may need to switch to a different profile. I'd suggest the blooming allongé if you need more extraction, the allongé or variant if you need about the same, or the modified dipper if you're working with something realtively developed.
   
      If the blooming profile is extracting too high for what you are thinking of as medium light, it’s probably more developed than you realize. You can cut the ratio shorter if the concentration won’t be a problem or cut shorter and add some water if it is. Otherwise, see the modified dipper suggested profile.
      This profile is useful up to 1:3, but expect extremely high flavor intensity relative to the ratio. 
3. Allonge
    
    A simple profile; grind a little coarser than normal and set debit to 4.5ml/s. Let it rip to a 1:4-1:5 ratio. Best for really light coffees, especially those that don't seem to be cooperating with the blooming version of this shot. This does extract a bit lower but is a great clarity profile.
    
    There's a modified version of this shot referred to as a turbo lever in the decent community. It can be pulled short (1:2 or so) as well. Set debit as high as possible and cut back as your gauge reads 6bar. You can also set an adjustable pump bypass or OPV to 6bar and just leave your paddle in place. Let it rip to your desired ratio, maintaining pressure as best you can.
4. Modified Dipper
    
    We’re going to quickly add water at the same rate we did with the bloom and manipulate the paddle to keep around 2-3 bar of pressure reading on the gauge. Hold here until first drips and then ramp to 7-8 bar. Puck erosion or paddle manipulation can be used for tapering if channels tend to form, but I hold the pressure up if the specific bean isn’t prone to channeling. Use ratio to dial extraction and strength, keeping in mind that you can always add water if your shot is too strong. Darker roasts can be overdosed relative to the basket if you’re a texture lover, but I don’t suggest you do this for mediums.
