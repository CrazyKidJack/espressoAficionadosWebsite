## Picking suitable profiles
One of the hardest things about making high and even extractions with an adjustable profiler is getting the coffee wetted relatively evenly. The pre-infusion type you pick has a large impact on how extreme the gradient between the top and bottom of the puck is. I'm an advocate for rapid preinfusion schemas; they get the coffee wet from top to bottom quickly and allow the user to move on to the next phase with no ill effects. Because there is a relatively large gradient of wetness in the puck using very slow preinfusion profiles, I tend to avoid recommending this method.

We've already covered the primary benefit you can derive from using a profiler. As a reminder, you can adjust the flow rate through your coffee more independtly of the grind size. In order to pick our profile, we're predominately determining what level of extraction we want for our chosen strength. If I want a 10% TDS shot at 28% extraction, there is probably only one profile capable of doing this.

Simply put, I recommend 4 base profiles that are fairly adaptable. They're listed here from high to low extraction. Videos coming soon.

1. Blooming allongé

   Recommended for ultra light coffees, especially nordic style filter roasts. I use an ultra fine or turkish grind. My current method is to use my known debit and a timer to add a little less than twice the dry weight of the puck in water as quickly as is reasonable (7ish ml/s) before closing the valve. I leave the valve closed for 30 seconds, and generally see about 4-10g in the cup at this point. I ramp to a debit of about 4.5 ml/s quite quickly and hold. Pressure rarely exceeds 6 bar and should taper naturally.
   
   1:4 ratios and up are the norm here, and extractions should be very high. Vibrant and juicy at ultra high extraction levels.
   
2. Blooming espresso
   
   Recommended for light to medium light coffees. This shot requires an ultra fine, or turkish grind. My current method is to use my known debit and a timer to add roughly twice the dry weight of the puck in water as quickly as is reasonable (7ish ml/s) before closing the valve. I leave the valve closed for 30 seconds, which is generally where i see first drip. Getting drips or even a small amount of flow sooner is ok if you can’t grind finer. I relatively smoothly ramp to 9 bar and hold after, though a taper could be useful if you’re prone to channeling.
   
      If the blooming is extracting too high for what you are thinking of as medium light, it’s probably more developed than you realize. You can cut the ratio shorter if the concentration won’t be a problem or cut shorter and add some water if it is. Otherwise, see the modified dipper suggested profile.
    This profile can be used for any ratio, but expect extremely high flavor intensity relative to the ratio.
3. Allonge
    
    A simple profile; grind a little coarser than normal and set debit to 4.5ml/s. Let it rip to a 1:4-1:5 ratio. Best for really light coffees, especially those that don't seem to be cooperating with the blooming version of this shot. This does extract a bit lower.
    
    There's a modified version of this shot referred to as a turbo lever in the decent community. It can be pulled short (1:2 or so) as well. Set debit as high as possible and cut back as your gauge reads 6bar. You can also set an adjustable pump bypass or OPV to 6bar and just leave your paddle in place. Let it rip to your desired ratio, maintaining pressure as best you can.
4. Modified Dipper
    
    We’re going to quickly add water at the same rate we did with the bloom and manipulate the paddle to keep around 2-3 bar of pressure reading on the gauge. Hold here until first drips and then ramp to 7-8 bar. Puck erosion or paddle manipulation can be used for tapering if channels tend to form, but I hold the pressure up if the specific bean isn’t prone to channeling. Use ratio to dial extraction and strength, keeping in mind that you can always add water if your shot is too strong. Darker roasts can be overdosed relative to the basket if you’re a texture lover, but I don’t suggest you do this for mediums.
